        Search for any news, up to the last 5 minutes or in our extensive historical archive
        filled with 100s of millions of articles.

        Geared toward low-latency applications, where time is of the essence. For example, this
        endpoint is commonly used for quickly getting news context for an LLM.

        This endpoint is also commonly used for synthetic data curation. For example, say you
        are fine-tuning a model for sports. You could filter  with `classification="Sports"`
        and build a dataset of sports articles.

        News articles come with an abundance of valuable metadata, including full summaries, sentiment,
        entities, reporting voice, page rank, language, and much much more.

        An example of this data in action can be found and interacted with at `https://asknews.app/chat`

        Get the chat completions for a given user message. This endpoint follows the
        OpenAI API spec. It includes a couple extra params, which include:

        - **journalist_mode**: Whether to activate an auto prompt that is more keen on AP styling,
        citations, and fair reporting. Setting to false, you get a vanilla LLM with the news pre
        added to the system prompt. No other prompting.
        - **inline_citations**: Decides how you want the bot to cite sources. It can use brackets,
        or it can also include the markdown with URL automatically.
        - **asknews_watermark**: Whether to include the AskNews watermark in the response.

        Make an expert forecast for a news event.

        This endpoint reaches into the news archive, looking back `lookback` days to
        extract the most relevant news articles, building a timeline of events, and
        then making an expert forecast.

        This endpoint is more expensive than the search endpoint, it is calling
        gpt-4o or claude 3-5 on approx 15k tokens to build the forecast.
        This endpoint counts toward "deep" calls in the billing system.

        It returns the forecast, the reasoning, and the sources.

        These stories are based on clusters of articles (which come through this

        stories and track them through time.

        The enrichments include a full Reddit overview (including all the thread metadata),
        as well as descriptions of the reporting voice, the key takeaways, contradictions,
        all the entities, and much, much more.
